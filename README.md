This project is an **Instagram Profile Generator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create a simulated Instagram profile by entering their username, bio, and uploading a profile picture along with multiple post images. The interface consists of input fields for user details and file uploads for images. Upon clicking the "Generate Profile" button, the profile preview is dynamically updated to display the entered details and uploaded images in an Instagram-like layout.

The design is clean and minimalistic, featuring a circular profile picture, a bio section, and a grid-style post gallery. JavaScript handles real-time image rendering using the FileReader API, ensuring an interactive and responsive experience. This project serves as a fun and practical tool for users to visualize their Instagram profile before actually updating their social media account.
